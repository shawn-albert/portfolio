## Overview

Built an autonomous, serverless pipeline that transforms care manager-patient conversations into structured clinical documentation and billable insights. The system orchestrates multiple AWS AI services through Step Functions to create a fully automated documentation workflow.

## Pipeline Flow

1. Care manager calls are automatically captured and landed in S3
2. Event-driven triggers initiate the serverless processing pipeline
3. Amazon Transcribe Medical converts medical conversations to accurate text
4. Amazon Bedrock generates comprehensive SOAP notes from transcriptions
5. Amazon Comprehend Medical extracts structured medical entities
6. Processed data is stored in Apache Iceberg format via Athena for downstream analysis

## Technical Architecture

<div className="space-y-2">
- Implemented event-driven S3 triggers for automated audio file processing
- Leveraged Amazon Transcribe Medical for accurate medical transcription
- Utilized Amazon Bedrock for generating comprehensive SOAP notes
- Integrated Amazon Comprehend Medical to extract:
    - ICD-10 diagnostic codes
    - Prescription information
    - Social determinants of health
    - SNOMED clinical terms
- Stored processed data in queryable format enabling reporting and ML model development
</div>

## Key Achievements

<div className="space-y-2">
- Built HIPAA-compliant data workflows implementing data encryption and role-based access controls with least-privilege principles
- Designed scalable architecture handling parallel processing of multiple care manager calls
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- Significantly reduced manual documentation overhead while improving billing accuracy
- Enabled downstream healthcare analytics through structured data storage
</div>

## Impact

The pipeline transforms the clinical documentation process from a manual task to an automated workflow, enabling healthcare providers to maximize direct patient care time while maintaining documentation accuracy and compliance standards.
