## Overview

Engineered a modern data platform leveraging Apache Iceberg and AWS services to create a scalable, serverless data lakehouse architecture. The platform implements a Bronze-Silver-Gold data paradigm with automated deployment through GitHub Actions and comprehensive data governance using AWS Lake Formation.

## Architecture Components

1. Data Ingestion Layer
   - AWS RDS (MySQL and PostgreSQL) as source systems
   - AWS Glue ETL jobs for data extraction and loading
   - CloudFormation and CDK for infrastructure deployment
   
2. Data Processing Layer
   - Apache Iceberg for table format management
   - AWS Lake Formation for data access control
   - AWS Glue Data Catalog for metadata management
   - AWS Athena with Spark workgroups for data processing
   
3. CI/CD Pipeline
   - GitHub Actions for automated deployment
   - Docker for containerization
   - AWS ECR for container registry
   - AWS ECS for container orchestration
   
4. Data Transformation
   - dbt for data transformations
   - SparkSQL for data processing
   - AWS Fargate for serverless compute

## Technical Implementation
