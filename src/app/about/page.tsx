                        As Director of Artificial Intelligence, I have dedicated my career to bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI innovation and real-world business outcomes. My journey combines a deep technical foundation in computer science with strategic business acumen, shaped by my education at the University of Chicago&apos;s MS in Computer Science program and Booth School of Business MBA.

                        What drives me is the potential of AI to revolutionize how organizations operate and serve their customers. Each project, whether implementing automated workflows or developing predictive models, is an opportunity to improve efficiency and deliver measurable impact. I believe in building systems that not only leverage cutting-edge technology but are also practical, scalable, and deliver real-world results.

                        At Belle, I architected agentic AI workflows using Amazon Bedrock, creating systems that automatically transform patient interactions into clinical documentation. This innovation helped healthcare providers spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork. The platform processed data from over 250,000 patient visits and 2.2 million clinical images, delivering cost savings of $800-1500 per Medicare Advantage member.

                        My work extends beyond just implementing AI â€“ I am passionate about building foundations that enable scalable innovation. I have engineered modern data platforms with an Apache Iceberg lakehouse architecture, dbt-Athena for data processing, and comprehensive data governance with LakeFormation. To ensure reliability at scale, I built automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, implementing infrastructure as code through Terraform and AWS CDK for consistent deployments from development to production.

                        Previously at Healthfirst, I led an MLOps transformation that dramatically reduced model deployment time from weeks to days. I also spearheaded the development of an innovative LLM-powered database query assistant that bridged relational and graph databases, making complex data accessible to non-technical users. At Aetna/CVS Health, I launched data science initiatives that generated $7.1M in projected annual savings and developed the Enhanced Maternity Program, which now serves 9.7M lives with $37M in annual revenue.

                        When I am not architecting AI solutions, you will find me exploring new technologies, mentoring upcoming data scientists and machine learning engineers, or thinking about the next big use case in enterprise AI. I am always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and innovators who share my passion for using AI to transform industries and make a meaningful impact.
