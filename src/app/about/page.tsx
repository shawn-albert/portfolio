                        As Director of Artificial Intelligence, I have dedicated my career to bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI innovation and real-world healthcare outcomes. My journey combines a deep technical foundation in computer science with strategic business acumen, shaped by my education at the University of Chicago&apos;s MS in Computer Science program and Booth School of Business MBA.

                        I thrive on building transformative AI solutions that make a tangible difference in healthcare delivery. At Belle, I architected agentic AI workflows using Amazon Bedrock and Step Functions, creating systems that automatically transform patient interactions into structured clinical documentation. This innovation helped healthcare providers spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork. Our platform now processes data from over 250,000 patient visits and 2.2 million clinical images, delivering impressive cost savings of $800-1500 per Medicare Advantage member.

                        My work extends beyond just implementing AI â€“ I am passionate about building robust foundations that enable scalable innovation. I have established comprehensive MLOps infrastructures, including an Apache Iceberg data lakehouse with dbt-Athena-SparkSQL integration, ensuring data governance through AWS Glue and LakeFormation. This technical architecture is complemented by automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS CDK, creating standardized deployments from innovation to production.

                      <TextReveal>
                        Previously at Healthfirst, I led an MLOps transformation that dramatically reduced model deployment time from weeks to days. I also spearheaded the development of an innovative LLM-powered database query assistant that bridged relational and graph databases, making complex data accessible to non-technical users. At Aetna/CVS Health, I launched data science initiatives that generated $7.1M in projected annual savings and developed the Enhanced Maternity Program, which now serves 9.7M lives with $37M in annual revenue.

                        What drives me is the potential of AI to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Each project, whether it is implementing automated clinical documentation or developing predictive health models, is an opportunity to improve patient outcomes and make healthcare more accessible and efficient. I believe in building systems that not only leverage cutting-edge technology but are also practical, scalable, and deliver measurable impact.

                        When I am not architecting AI solutions, you will find me exploring new technologies, mentoring upcoming data scientists and machine learning engineers, or thinking about the next big innovation in healthcare AI. I am always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and healthcare innovators who share my passion for using AI to make a difference in people&apos;s lives.
